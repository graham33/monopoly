  <title>Original Route</title>

  <updated>16th December 2007</updated>

  <introduction>The route encompasses all 26 streets and stations on
  the Monopoly board, leaving out the Electric Company, Water Works
  etc.  However there are a few compromises: we don't visit the pubs
  in the order on the board and in some cases there simply isn't a pub
  on the actual street.  Also we were recently asked to remove a pub
  from the list (the last one) so you'll have to use on of the
  alternatives.  Public transport is used extensively, so you'll need
  a <emph>Zone 1-2 Travelcard</emph>.  The times given are the times
  we expect to leave the pub.  An <emph>A-Z map</emph> might also come
  in handy.  Remember to be careful when crossing the road, especially
  as the night wears on!</introduction>

  <start>Meet at <emph>Elephant and Castle tube station</emph>
  (Bakerloo and Northern lines) at <emph>10:15</emph> to leave
  promptly at <emph>10:30</emph>.  Any latecomers can catch up at one
  of the later pubs.  The meeting point is the main Elephant and
  Castle station entrance, not the shopping centre entrance which is
  on the opposite side of the roundabout.  Follow signs for South Bank
  University inside the station to reach it.</start>

    <directions>Cross Tower Hill Road outside The George and get the
    <emph>42</emph> bus from the bus stop there.  There may be other bus routes that go over Tower Bridge so check the bus stop information.This will take
    you north across Tower Bridge.  Alight at the next stop, Tower
    Gateway DLR station.  Continue up Minories and turn left into
    Crosswall.  Continue straight through Crutched Friars until the
    road becomes Hart Street.  At which point take the turn to the
    right, past The Goose pub and into the square.  Enter Fenchurch
    Street station and go up the escalator.  The Raven is behind and
    to the right.  On the last visit, construction work had blocked up
    the main station entrance, and The Raven appeared to be
    closed.</directions>

    <directions>Leave the station turning right at the bottom of the
    escalators.  There is a branch of Benjy's here which sells, among
    other things, fortifying bacon sandwiches.  Leave the square on
    the right hand side and turn right into Fenchurch Street.
    Continue until the road becomes Aldgate High Street and cross in
    front of St. Boltoph's Church.  Cross the road via the subway on

    <directions>There are two options: walk to Liverpool Street or
    take the tube.  Walking may well be faster if the Hammersmith and
    City line is closed or delayed. To walk, head back the way you
    came to Middlesex Street.  Go all the way down this road past
    Petticoat Lane and you will see Liverpool Street station in front
    of you.  To take the tube, walk the short distance to Aldgate East
    tube station.  From here take the Hammersmith and City line to
    Liverpool Street.  Walk up into the main station area and go up to
    street level at the Bishopsgate end.  At the end of the station to
    the right is The Hamilton Hall.</directions>

    <directions>There are two options: the bus or the tube.  The bus
    is a lot less walking but the tube can be faster if the bus takes
    a long time to arrive.  <emph>If taking the bus</emph>, leave the
    bar by the entrance inside the station by the toilets.  Walk along
    the gallery to the other end of the station, past McDonalds
    (another food opportunity).  Take the <emph>214 bus from stop
    C</emph>.  This will take you through Finsbury Circus and along
    City Road until it reaches the Angel Islington.  Alight just
    before the main junction where there is a green clock in the road
    to your left.  Cross the side road and enter the passage way
    marked with a sign for The Old Red Lion.  <emph>If taking the
    tube</emph>, walk around the back of Liverpool Street station past
    the UBS building, and then take the road that curves round to the
    right.  Turn left down Moorgate where you will find Moorgate tube
    station, where you can take the Northern line to Angel.  At Angel,
    walk across City Road at the cross roads, the front entrace to the
    Red Lion is a short distance down on the left.</directions>

    <directions>This link is a little difficult.  Carry on up Euston Road until you reach Euston Square (<emph>note</emph> not Euston) station.

    <directions>This is probably the longest link between pubs, depending on how reliable London Transport is.  Leave the station by the main entrance and walk straight ahead across the road to the bus stop.  Here you need to catch a bus to Baker Street, preferably the number 2.  The number 2 will take you all the way, but otherwise you will need to change at Baker Street to get a <emph>2, 74 or 82 bus</emph> in the direction of Hyde Park Corner.  Alight on Park Lane just outside the London Hilton hotel.  Continue southwards and take the left hand road, Old Park Lane.  At the end of the road is the Rose &amp; Crown.</directions>

    <directions>Another reasonably long link.  Go down Craven Passage
    to the left of the pub.  Now there are two options: get the bus,
    or get the tube.  The bus seems to be the best choice.  To get to
    the bus stop, turn left just before the tunnel and walk up to The
    Strand.  Cross the road (with care), and get the <emph>11, 15 or
    23</emph> from stop <emph>F</emph> to Fleet Street.  Stop before
    you reach Ludgate Hill and Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is in a
    (signposted) passage to your left.  To get the tube, keep going
    under the tunnel until you reach Villiers Street.  There are some
    fast food establishments here for a quick take-away.  Turn right
    and walk down to Embankment Station.  Take the District or Circle
    line going east two stops to Blackfriars.  Take Exit 8 from the
    station and walk up to Ludgate Circus.  Take a left here down
    Fleet Street and about 100 yards on the right is the passage to
    the pub.</directions>

    <directions>Go back out onto Fleet Street and continue walking.
    There is a McDonalds if more take-away food is required.  You can
    get a bus, but it's easier to walk down.  Go past the Royal Courts
    of Justice, past the BBC World Service in Bush House, and the
    church on an island in the centre of the road.  Just past Waterloo
    Bridge we enter the Strand where you should see The Wellington
    straight ahead.</directions>

    <directions>Unfortunately this stop is a bit complicated!  Turn
    left then right out of the pub down Carlton Street onto Lower
    Regent Street.  Head up to Piccadilly Circus, then left down
    Piccadilly.  Cross at the second set of pedestrian lights in front
    of St. James' Church.  Head up Swallow Street and you'll see Vine
    Street to your right.  There used to be a bar on the corner here,
    but at the time of writing the space is being redeveloped
    (hopefully into a bar!).  Carry on up Swallow Street and you'll
    pass two of your alternatives on your left: Bentley's Below and
    Gaucho's.  Unfortunately these places are not likely to let a big
    group in at this time, so emerge onto Regent Street, go to the
    left and cross to enter Glasshouse Street on your right, where
    you'll find the Leicester Arms and The Warwick.</directions>

    <directions>Unfortunately we have had to remove the pub we usually have here (see the description for details), so we'll have to go for an untested one.  Come out of the pub and go left along Great Marlborough Street, you'll see the Magistrates Court in front of you. Cross Regent Street at the end and go down Hanover Street to Hanover Square. Go round the square to the opposite North West corner and proceed down Tenterden Street. On Dering Street is the Hogshead.</directions>

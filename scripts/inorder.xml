  <title>In-Order Route</title>

  <updated>16th December 2007</updated>

  <introduction>The route encompasses all 26 streets and stations on
  the Monopoly board, leaving out the Electric Company, Water Works
  etc.  This route attempts to visit the pubs in the order the squares
  appear on the board and attempts to use a pub/bar actually on the
  street whever possible.  The stations are strictly optional as they
  can add quite a lot to the time (especially at the end) and you may
  risk running out of time unless you get on with it earlier on.
  Public transport is used extensively, so you'll need a <emph>Zone
  1-2 Travelcard</emph>.  The times given are the times we expect to
  leave the pub.  An <emph>A-Z map</emph> might also come in handy.
  Remember to be careful when crossing the road, especially as the
  night wears on!</introduction>

  <start>Meet at <emph>Elephant and Castle tube station</emph>
  (Bakerloo and Northern lines) at <emph>10:15</emph> to leave
  promptly at <emph>10:30</emph>.  Any latecomers can catch up at one
  of the later pubs.  <emph>The meeting point is the main Elephant and
  Castle station entrance, not the shopping centre entrance which is
  on the opposite side of the roundabout.  Follow signs for South Bank
  University inside the station to reach it.</emph></start>

    <directions>Cross Tower Hill Road outside 
The George and get the <emph>42</emph> bus from the bus stop there.  There may be other bus routes that go over Tower Bridge so check the bus stop information.
This will take you north across Tower Bridge. Carry on past Tower Gateway and up to Aldgate.  Get off the bus and walk down Aldgate High Street, across Middlesex street (under the subway) and onto Whitechapel.  The pub is just to the left beyond the tube station.

    <directions>Take the <emph>11, 15 or 23</emph> back up to Charing Cross.  Cross the Strand in front of the station and take the little "slip road" (Duncannon Street) towards Trafalgar Square/Charing Cross road.  The pub is just on the left.  Note: last time we did this, the pub was for 'a certain clientelle', if you get my drift!</directions>

    This is where it becomes a bit of a shag if you're doing stations.
    The round trip here is likely to add 30 minutes onto the time.  Go
    back around the corner to Charing Cross and walk down to
    embankment tube station.  Take the District Line to Tower Hill.
    Come out of the station and turn left and then left again onto the
    Minories. Continue up Minories and turn left into Crosswall.
    Continue straight through Crutched Friars until the road becomes
    Hart Street.  At which point take the turn to the right, past The
    Goose pub and into the square.  Enter Fenchurch Street station and
    go up the escalator.  The Raven is behind and to the right.  On
    the last visit, construction work had blocked up the main station
    entrance, and The Raven appeared to be closed.</directions>

    <directions>Take a diagonal route across Leicester Square and exit by the Swiss Centre to your right.  Here might be a good place for eating - there is a McDonalds, a KFC and a Pizza Hut if you're very ahead of schedule.  Cross Whitcomb Street into Coventy Street and then take the first left down Oxenden Street.  The Comedy is about halfway down on the right.</directions>

    <directions>Back up to Conventry Street and turn left towards Piccadilly Circus. Cross Piccadilly Circus to Piccadilly and walk down until you get to Fortnum and Mason.  Biaggio is on the left (its easy to miss) and you have to go upstairs to the cocktail bar.  Beware!  Many a pub crawl has foundered on the lovely cocktails here.</directions>

    <directions>Turn right out of the bar onto Piccadilly. Walk along until you can cut up through to Regent street (where you came earlier to get to Vine Street).  It may be worth getting a bus here on you can walk all the way up Regent Street, across Oxford Street until you reach the All Bar One on you left, on the corner of Magaret Street.</directions>

    <directions>We don't know of any pubs on this end of Oxford
    Street, so we have to go for a side street instead.  Walk back
    down Regent Street and turn right onto Oxford Street.  About 200
    yards on the left turn into Woodstock Street.  The Spread Eagle is
    just round the corner, opposite The Woodstock.</directions>

    <description>The owner of the pub we previously had
    for this stop has asked us to remove his pub from the site.  It
    appears he was having a lot of trouble from pub crawlers who were
    very noisy and disruptive.  Once again <emph>please</emph> try to drink
    within your limits - this kind of thing only ruins the pub crawl

    <directions>This is where you are really going to regret doin stations.  Again this is at least 30 minute, if not 40, round trip.
    Walk up New Bond Street and turn left onto Oxford Street.  Head for Bond Street Station and take the Central Line to Liverpool Street.
    Walk up into the main station area and go up to street level at the Bishopsgate end.  At the end of the station to the right is The Hamilton Hall.</directions>

    <directions><emph>From Bond Street</emph>: Take New Bond Street back up to Oxford Street.  Either hop on a bus or walk down Oxford Street to Marble Arch.  Turn left onto Park Lane, and continue on down.  Just after you pass the Hilton, Old Park Lane dives off to the left parallel to Park Lane.  The pub is down here on the left.
    <emph>From Liverpool Street</emph>:  Take the Central Line again all the way back to Marble Arch.  Sounds easy, but you will be quite pushed for time now.  Follow the directions above from Marble Arch station.</directions>

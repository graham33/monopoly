  <h1>In-Order Route</h1>
</div><p class="introduction">The route encompasses all 26 streets and stations on
  the Monopoly board, leaving out the Electric Company, Water Works
  etc.  This route attempts to visit the pubs in the order the squares
  appear on the board and attempts to use a pub/bar actually on the
  street whever possible.  The stations are strictly optional as they
  can add quite a lot to the time (especially at the end) and you may
  risk running out of time unless you get on with it earlier on.
  Public transport is used extensively, so you'll need a <b>Zone
  1-2 Travelcard</b>.  The times given are the times we expect to
  leave the pub.  An <b>A-Z map</b> might also come in handy.
  Remember to be careful when crossing the road, especially as the
  night wears on!</p><h2>Starting Off</h2><p class="start">Meet at <b>Elephant and Castle tube station</b>
  (Bakerloo and Northern lines) at <b>10:15</b> to leave
  promptly at <b>10:30</b>.  Any latecomers can catch up at one
  of the later pubs.  <b>The meeting point is the main Elephant and
  Castle station entrance, not the shopping centre entrance which is
  on the opposite side of the roundabout.  Follow signs for South Bank
  University inside the station to reach it.</b></p><h2>1. Old Kent Road</h2><table class="stop">

    <h1>The Monopoly Pub Crawl</h1>

    <p>After our third successful attempt at the Monopoly pub crawl,
    we thought we should put up a page about it.  Here you can find
    the route, as well as some pictures of the event itself.</p>

    <p>Try out the new <a href="/map/original/">Monopoly Pub Crawl Google Map</a>, and visit <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Monopoly-Pub-Crawl/114510971899387">The Monopoly Pub Crawl on Facebook</a>!</p>
    
    <h2>The Route</h2>

    <p>We've made a route guide for the Monopoly Pub Crawl complete
    with nice pictures of each pub and directions in between.  At some
    point we'll put up a printable version.  There are now two
    different routes for you to choose from:</p>

    <p><span class="routelink"><a
    href="/route/original/">The original route</a></span>
    The route is based on an <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/clem_uk/MONO2.HTM">old
    version</a> which we used on our first few attempts.  We've
    updated it as the pubs have changed and to deal with the bus
    routes being renumbered over the years.</p>

    <p><span class="routelink"><a href="/route/inorder/">The in-order route</a></span>
    This visits most of the same pubs as the original route, but does
    so in the order that they appear on the Monopoly board.
    Consequently there are more time constraints when doing this
    route.  The station stops are optional, since leaving them out
    makes the route easier, and avoids some very wasteful travelling
    from one side of London to the other and then back again.  The
    route was contributed by Gus Paul.
    </p>

    <p>We were recently asked to remove the pub we had for Oxford
    Street from the list.  So if you do the crawl, please report back
    on where you went (we've put some alternatives in from
    <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com">http://www.beerintheevening.com</a>).</p>

    <h2>The Strategy</h2>

    <p>26 pubs might seem like a tall order, and it is if you have a
    pint in each one.  Since we prefer to finish the whole route
    rather than pass out halfway through we usually go for a half pint
    in each.  There's usually at least half an hour to spare at the
    last pub for more drinking.  It's a fun day out whether you're
    drinking or not.  If you are drinking, you can make it a lot
    easier on yourself by eating at every possible opportunity and by
    drinking water as the day goes on.</p>

    <p><b>Please drink within your limits</b>.  Remember that
    landlords, bouncers and patrons are not going to be too happy with
    a huge crowd of loud drunkards turning up for quick half.  In
    particular we have had to <b>remove two pubs from the list
    recently</b> because landlords were unhappy. So it's best to try
    to keep to a reasonable level of sobriety and volume if you want
    to finish the crawl and not ruin it for everyone else!  If there
    are is a large group of you, try to split up into smaller groups
    near the end and go into different pubs if there's more than one
    available.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, remember to stay safe while doing the crawl.
    It's easy to think you're invincible when you've had a bit to
    drink, so be careful of the London roads and follow the <a

    Code</a>!</p>
